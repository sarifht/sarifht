# Hi There👋 I'm Sarif Hidayatullah😎
You can call me <b>Sarif</b> not <s>SaRIP</s> yeah 😭 👉👈

Nice to meet you there! and welcome to my profile 🍷 I'm passionate about exploring the world of software engineering, especially front-end development. Let's learn together, and I hope you enjoy the journey as well! 😜😝

I’ve been in UI/UX for a while as a facilitator. Now, I’m diving into Flutter and React while staying passionate about UI/UX and tech! 🔥

- 🙌 Let's connect on LinkedIn, you can find the link in my profile on the left.

## Tech Stack
I'm still diving into these technologies, and honestly, I'm loving every challenge that comes my way ☕. Sure, there are moments when it gets frustrating and I feel down 😭😓🤯, but there are also times when I get a real boost from finally getting something 😊😅🥰.

I wouldn’t say I've got it all figured out yet ✌️. I'm learning as I go, working on projects, and constantly pushing myself 🚀. The more I learn, the more I realize how much there’s still left to learn 🌱.
